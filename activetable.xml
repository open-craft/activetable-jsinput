<p>
  This is an ActiveTable problem, allowing you to place input fields in the cell
  of a table.  You can edit the table and declare the cells that are input cells
  by clicking EDIT above and following the instructions in the Python code.
</p>
<p>
  It is recommended to set "Randomization" to "On Reset" and "Show Reset Button"
  to "True" in the settings, even when the problem does not involve any
  randomization.  This will ensure that students can correctly reload a changed
  version of a problem they've already worked on after a member of staff edited
  the problem.  You can change the problem settings by clicking EDIT above, then
  SETTINGS in the top right corner of the edit window.
